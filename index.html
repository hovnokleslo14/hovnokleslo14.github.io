            <p>I like to do anything that is creative. That's why I learned all the skills I have. If I don't do anything creative for a long time, I can't think or live normally. I have to express my feelings into something or do it just for the joy of the result. Currently I can code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (I started learning that when I was 10 or 13, I don't know exactly).</p>

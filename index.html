            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>For the quick introduction, I am pansexual femboy furry. I love coding and just about anything that is digital and creative. You can read my full about me below.</p>

        <div class="section" id="creativity">
            <h2>Creativity</h2>
            <p>I like to do anything that is creative. That's why I learned all the skills I have. If I don't do anything creative for a long time, I can't think or live normally. I have to express my feelings into something or do it just for the joy of the result. Currently I can code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (I started learning that when I was 10 or 13, I don't know exactly).</p>

        <div class="section" id="personality">
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>I am really sensitive yet easily manage to get upset by certain things. I am pretty positively thinking person maybe even could tell myself am hippie type of guy. I do love meeting new people, but be slow at me as I am still pretty much introverted. I am also in the furry community for about 3 years now.</p>

        <div class="section" id="sexuality-relations">
            <h2>Sexuality and Relations</h2>
            <p>I am pansexual and that's how it is. I didn't choose this I kind of lived with it until I noticed I am different. I am submissive and bottom if you would want to know. Currently I am happily taken by my love Gabrielkou, so do not try anything at me.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies and Likings</h2>
            <p>From my personal hobbies it's mainly playing wydeoher and programming small applications and calling with friends on discord or I would like to be outside by the fire but I have no one to be with because a lot of people don't like me just because I'm different but so it doesn't matter. :D</p>

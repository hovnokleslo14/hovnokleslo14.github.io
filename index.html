            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>For the quick introduction, I am pansexual femboy furry. I love coding and just about anything that is digital and creative. You can read my full about me below.</p>

        <div class="section" id="creativity">
            <h2>Creativity</h2>
            <p>I like to do anything that is creative. That's why I learned all the skills I have. If I don't do anything creative for a long time, I can't think or live normally. I have to express my feelings into something or do it just for the joy of the result. Currently I can code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (I started learning that when I was 10 or 13, I don't know exactly).</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>I am really sensitive yet easily manage to get upset by certain things. I am pretty positively thinking person maybe even could tell myself am hippie type of guy. I do love meeting new people, but be slow at me as I am still pretty much introverted. I am also in the furry community for about 3 years now.</p>
